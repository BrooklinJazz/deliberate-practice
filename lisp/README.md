## Installation
- ubuntu
    sudo apt-get clisp
## Run/Compile on CMD line
```clisp```
## Run/Compile a file
```clisp <filename>.lisp```
e.g. clisp clisp_hello_world.lisp

## How to write hello world
(print "hello world")

## What is the basic syntax?

## Why would I use this?
Using Lisp is "an extremely valuable learning experience".

I can't see many people talking about common business cases for lisp. one of the main uses seems to be for Artificial Intelligence.

## Where did this originate? basic history
LISP: "list processing" was developed by John McCarthy at the Massachusets Institute of Technology (MIT) in about 1960. it is the second oldest high-level programming language in widespread use today

LISP was founded on the mathematical theory of recursive functions. a LISP program is a function applied to data rather than being a sequence of procedural steps as in FORTRAN and ALGOL

LISP is a functional programming language.

As one of the earliest programming languages, Lisp pioneered many ideas in computer science, including tree data structures, automatic storage management, dynamic typing, conditionals, higher-order functions, recursion, the self-hosting compiler,[7] and the read–eval–print loop.[8]

Lisp was first implemented by Steve Russell on an IBM 704 computer using punched cards.[12] Russell had read McCarthy's paper and realized (to McCarthy's surprise) that the Lisp eval function could be implemented in machine code.[13] The result was a working Lisp interpreter which could be used to run Lisp programs, or more properly, "evaluate Lisp expressions".

Steve Russel also created Spacewar in 1961 - or atleast I watched a video of him at the computer history museum.
