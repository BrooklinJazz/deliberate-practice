## Where did this originate?
LISP: "list processing" was developed by John McCarthy at the Massachusets Institute of Technology (MIT)

LISP was founded on the mathematical theory of recursive functions. a LISP program is a function applied to data rather than being a sequence of procedural steps as in FORTRAN and ALGOL
