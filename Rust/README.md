## Installation
install Rust is through a tool called Rustup, which is a Rust installer and version management tool.
`curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`

start a new project with cargo new projectname
build your project with cargo build
run your project with cargo run
test your project with cargo test
build documentation for your project with cargo doc
publish a library to crates.io with cargo publish

I tried cargo build and got could not find 'Cargo.toml'. but this is because to make a new project you run:
`cargo new hello-rust`. then cd into the project and run `cargo run`
